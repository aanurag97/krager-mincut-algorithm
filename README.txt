The communities identification in large graph data is done to clusters various groups
in the data. Krager's min_cut algorithm is one the methods of implementing the
community detection in a large dataset.

The "main.py" file consist of the implmentation of the algorithm for large datasets.
The input to the file is in form of .txt file which contains edges of the graph at each
line.

To run the file from python shell/terminal, use following format:

python3 main.py *path_to_file*

"path_to_file" is the location of the .txt file containing the graph dataset.

The "dataset_format.txt" file is for reference for the input file format.

The "facebook_combined.txt" file is a large open source dataset available at
http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.htm along with many other similar datasets.
